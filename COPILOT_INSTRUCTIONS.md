# Learning Plan
1. **AWS Basics Revision**
   - Review key AWS services: EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, VPC.
   - Understand AWS security best practices.
   - Familiarize with AWS CLI commands.

2. **Terraform Fundamentals**
   - Learn Terraform syntax and structure.
   - Understand how to define resources, variables, and outputs.
   - Explore Terraform commands: `init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`.

3. **Docker Deployment**
   - Study Docker concepts: images, containers, Dockerfile.
   - Learn how to build and run Docker containers.
   - Understand Docker networking and volumes.

4. **Integration Journey**
   - Plan how AWS, Terraform, and Docker will work together.
   - Document challenges faced during integration.
   - Outline best practices for managing infrastructure as code.

# Documentation Plan
- Create markdown files for each learning topic in the `docs` directory.
- Take notes on key concepts, commands, and examples.
- Document mistakes and lessons learned in each section.
- Capture screenshots of important steps and processes in the `screenshots` directory.

# Execution Plan
1. **AWS Basics Revision**
   - Start with `docs/01-aws-basics-revision.md`.
   - Take notes and revise AWS concepts.
   - Capture screenshots of the AWS Management Console as needed.

2. **Terraform Fundamentals**
   - Move to `docs/02-terraform-fundamentals.md`.
   - Learn Terraform syntax and commands.
   - Experiment with simple Terraform configurations.

3. **Docker Deployment**
   - Document Docker deployment in `docs/03-docker-deployment.md`.
   - Create a basic Dockerfile and build a sample image.
   - Run the container and take screenshots of the process.

4. **Integration Journey**
   - Outline the integration steps in `docs/04-integration-journey.md`.
   - Document the process of linking AWS, Terraform, and Docker.
   - Note any challenges and solutions encountered.

5. **Terraform Infrastructure as Code**
   - Start building the Terraform modules in the `terraform` directory.
   - Begin with the networking module, defining VPCs and subnets.
   - Use `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply` to provision resources.

6. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Review and refine each section of the documentation.
   - Update the Terraform configurations based on lessons learned.
   - Continue to capture screenshots and document the journey.

# Additional Notes
- Remember to take screenshots whenever you complete a significant step or encounter an important concept.
- Keep the documentation updated as you progress through each phase of the project.
- Use the `.md` files to reflect on your learning and any mistakes made along the way.
